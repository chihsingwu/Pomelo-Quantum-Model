A projection model of quantum collapse inspired by pomelo geometry.
# Pomelo Collapse Projection Model (PCPM)

A high-dimensional projection framework inspired by quantum interference and the geometric structure of pomelo peel patterns.

## Abstract

This project introduces a novel model — **Pomelo Collapse Projection Model (PCPM)** — which interprets quantum wave collapse as a dimensional projection process. The model is visually and conceptually inspired by the layered geometry of sliced pomelo skin, drawing analogies to the stepwise loss of spatial information observed in quantum interference patterns.

The core concept posits that observed phenomena (e.g., fringes in a double-slit experiment) result from a projection from an n-dimensional wave field into an m-dimensional observation space (typically, m = 3). The model seeks to bridge geometric intuition with probabilistic collapse mechanics in quantum systems.
